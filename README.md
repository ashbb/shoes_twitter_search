Shoes Twitter Search
====================
See what's happening ? *right now*.

This is a mantra on the [Twitter Seach](http://search.twitter.com/) web site.

**Shoes Twitter Search** is a tiny Shoes app which find and keep up with tweets what you are interested in.


Usage
-----
- download zip file and do unzip
- change directory to `lib`
- run `shoes_twitter_search.rb` with your Shoes

Default search words are `Shoes RubyLearning`.
You can delete them with `backspace` key and reinput new keywords.

If you click on an upper right deepskyblue star, Shoes Twitter Search searches them immediately. If you do nothing, it'll search every 60 seconds.
